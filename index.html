        <p>The <strong>Bonobo</strong> (<em>Pan paniscus</em>), is distinguished by relatively long legs, 
            pink lips, dark face, tail-tuft through adulthood, and parted long hair 
            on its head. The bonobo is found in a 500,000 km2 area of the
            Congo Basin in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo" target="_blank">
            Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>, Central Africa. The 
            species is frugivorous and inhabits primary and secondary forests, 
            including seasonally inundated swamp forests. Because of political 
            instability in the region and the timidity of bonobos, there has been 
            relatively little field work done observing the species in its natural 
            habitat. </p>
